## Files

-  [4203-Project-Report-Intrusion-Detection.pdf](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/4203-Project-Report-Intrusion-Detection.pdf) is the pdf for the completed project report. This document describes the processes used by our implementation, and the achieved results.

- Attack Dataset files not included as they are very large, however all datasets were created from the [AWID3](https://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/awid3) dataset.

- The CSV dataset we used to train the models is not included as the file is too large.

- `/code/` directory:
	- [CaptureToFlow.py](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/code/CaptureToFlow.py) contains helper functions that translate captures or datasets to n-gram flows.
	- [FlowToFeatures.py](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/code/FlowToFeatures.py) contains helper functions to extract probabilitiy features from n-gram flows.
	- [WIDSNetwork.py](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/code/WIDSNetwork.py) contains functions to train, save, and test ML models.

- `/results/` directory:
	- [example_live_output.txt](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/results/example_live_output.txt) contains output created using our AdaBoost model to classify packets generated by a live capture.
	- [trace.pcap](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/results/trace.pcap) is the live capture file that was generated.
	- [ResultsGraphs.png](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/results/ResultsGraphs.png) shows the visual accuracy results for the AdaBoost model.
	- [ResultsGraphs2.png](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/results/ResultsGraphs2.png) shows the visual accuracy results for the RandomForest model.
	- [ResultsGraphs3.png](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/results/ResultsGraphs3.png) compares our obtained results with those found in the refferenced paper.

- `/trained-models/` directory:
	- [smallDsModel5000.pkl](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/trained-models/smallDsModel5000.pkl) is the saved (pickle) model using the AdaBoost classifer.
	- [smallDsModel5000-Random.pkl](https://github.com/JakeJazokas/ML-Intrusion-Detection/blob/main/trained-models/smallDsModel5000-Random.pkl) is the saved (pickle) model using the RandomForest classifer.

## Execution

- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python modules.

- Run `python code\WIDSNetwork.py` from the main directory. This will run a demo that will print the general accuracy of our trained RandomForest classifer model.
